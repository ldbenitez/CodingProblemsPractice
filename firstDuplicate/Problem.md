# First Duplicate (CodeSignal)

## Description

Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. 
In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.

### Examples
 - For a = [2,1,3,5,3,2], the output should be 3.
 - For a = [2,2], the output should be 2.
 - For a [2,4,3,5,1], the output should be -1.

### Constraints
- 1<= a.length <= 10^5
- 1<= a[i] <= a.length
